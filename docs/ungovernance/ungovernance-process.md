# Ungovernance Process

## 1. Steps to Deploy Automation Infrastructure

There are three steps that a new smart contract which automates GEB should go through:

* Adding the contract into a bug bounty program
* Deploying and testing the contract on a testnet for several weeks
* Deploying the contract on mainnet

## 2. Current Infrastructure Being Tested

* [Collateral Auction Throttler](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-collateral-auction-throttler/blob/master/src/CollateralAuctionThrottler.sol)

## 3. Already Deployed Infrastructure

* [Single Debt Ceiling Setter](https://github.com/reflexer-labs/geb-debt-ceiling-setter/blob/master/src/SingleSpotDebtCeilingSetter.sol)
