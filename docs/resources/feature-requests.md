# Feature Requests

## Contract Calls

We are constantly adding more features and powerful tools to our stack.

If you have a particular smart contract that you would like to interact with through our API that is not a regular ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155 please reach out. We are happy to work with our partners to quickly add new custom endpoints.

## Logins, OAuth and Integration

We use standard industry tools to improve the developer experience. If there is another way you would like to access Keyp logins, please contact us.
